Implementation of the actual schedule generation can be found in *ScheduleWidgets.py*. To add another trial sequence, implement a new schedule widgets in *ScheduleWidgets.py*.

It is recommended to separate the implementation script and the design script and put the implementation script in the module *ScheduleWidgets.py*

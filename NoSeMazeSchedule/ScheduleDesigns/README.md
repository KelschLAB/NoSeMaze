# ScheduleDesigns

This package contains the UI desings for the schedule widgets and some other widgets. To implement a schedule widget in [ScheduleWidgets.py](../ScheduleModels/ScheduleWidgets.py), it is recommended to separate implementation script and design script and put the design script here.

The modules are created using PyQt5 UI generator and modified as needed.

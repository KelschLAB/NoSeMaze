# Designs

This package contains the design classes of the windows used in the controller UI. To implement a window in [AppWindows.py](../Windows/AppWindows.py), it is recommended to seperate the implementation of a window and the design of the window into two separate scripts, that the scripts have a better overview.

The modules are created using PyQt5 UI generator and modified as needed.
